The database scheme consists of four tables:
Product (maker, model (PRIMARY KEY), type)
PC (code (PRIMARY KEY), model (FOREING KEY referring to the Product table), speed, ram, hd, cd, price)
Laptop (code (PRIMARY KEY), model (FOREING KEY referring to the Product table), speed, ram, hd, price, screen)
Printer (code (PRIMARY KEY), model (FOREING KEY referring to the Product table), color, type, price)

1. Find the model number, speed and hard drive capacity for all the PCs with prices below $500.
Result set: model, speed, hd.

SELECT model, speed, hd FROM PC
WHERE price < 500

2. List all printer makers. Result set: maker.

SELECT Distinct maker FROM Product
WHERE type = 'Printer'

3. Find all records from the Printer table containing data about color printers.

SELECT * FROM Printer
WHERE color = 'y'

4. Find the model number, speed and hard drive capacity of PCs cheaper than $600 having a 12x or a 24x CD drive.

SELECT model, speed, hd FROM PC
WHERE price < 600
AND (cd = '12x' OR cd = '24x')

5. Find the model number, RAM and screen size of the laptops with prices over $1000.

SELECT model, ram, screen FROM Laptop
WHERE price > 1000

6. For each maker producing laptops with a hard drive capacity of 10 Gb or higher, find the speed of such laptops.
Result set: maker, speed.

SELECT Distinct maker, speed FROM Product
INNER JOIN Laptop ON Product.model=Laptop.model
WHERE hd >= 10

7. Get the models and prices for all commercially available products (of any type) produced by maker B.

SELECT Product.model, price FROM Product
INNER JOIN PC ON Product.model = PC.model
WHERE maker = 'B'
UNION
SELECT Product.model, price FROM Product
INNER JOIN Laptop ON Product.model = Laptop.model
WHERE maker = 'B'
UNION
SELECT Product.model, price FROM Product
INNER JOIN Printer ON Product.model = Printer.model
WHERE maker = 'B'

8. Find the makers producing PCs but not laptops.

SELECT DISTINCT maker FROM Product
WHERE type = 'PC'
AND maker NOT IN (SELECT maker FROM Product WHERE type = 'Laptop')

9. Find the makers of PCs with a processor speed of 450 MHz or more. Result set: maker.

SELECT DISTINCT maker FROM Product
INNER JOIN PC ON Product.model = PC.model
WHERE PC.speed >= 450

10. Find the printer models having the highest price. Result set: model, price.

SELECT DISTINCT model, price FROM Printer
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM Printer)

11. Find out the average speed of the laptops priced over $1000.

SELECT AVG(speed) FROM Laptop
WHERE Laptop.price > 1000

12. Find out the average speed of the PCs produced by maker A.

SELECT AVG(speed) FROM PC
WHERE model IN (SELECT model FROM Product WHERE maker = 'A')

13. Get hard drive capacities that are identical for two or more PCs. Result set: hd.

SELECT hd FROM PC
GROUP BY hd
HAVING COUNT(model) >=2

14. Get pairs of PC models with identical speeds and the same RAM capacity.
Each resulting pair should be displayed only once, i.e. (i, j) but not (j, i).
Result set: model with the bigger number, model with the smaller number, speed, and RAM.

SELECT DISTINCT A.model, B.model, A.speed, A.ram FROM PC A, PC B
WHERE A.model > B.model
AND A.speed = B.speed
AND A.ram = B.ram

15. Get the laptop models that have a speed smaller than the speed of any PC.
Result set: type, model, speed.

SELECT DISTINCT Product.type, Laptop.model, Laptop.speed FROM Laptop, Product
WHERE Product.type = 'Laptop'
AND Laptop.speed < ANY (SELECT MIN(speed) FROM PC)

16. For each maker having models in the Laptop table, find out the average screen size of the laptops he produces.
Result set: maker, average screen size.

SELECT Product.maker, AVG(Laptop.screen) FROM Laptop
INNER JOIN Product ON Product.model = Laptop.model
GROUP BY Product.maker

17. Find the makers producing at least three distinct models of PCs.
Result set: maker, number of PC models.

SELECT maker, COUNT(model) AS count FROM Product
WHERE type = 'PC'
GROUP BY maker
HAVING COUNT(model) >= 3

18. Find out the maximum PC price for each maker having models in the PC table.
Result set: maker, maximum price.

SELECT Product.maker, MAX(PC.price) FROM Product, PC
WHERE Product.model = PC.model
GROUP BY maker

19. For each value of PC speed that exceeds 600 MHz, find out the average price of PCs with identical speeds.
Result set: speed, average price.

SELECT speed, AVG(price) AS average_price FROM PC
WHERE speed > 600
GROUP BY speed
